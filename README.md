# jsonmapper

1\. Write a golang data mapper project which will map one json structure
to another 2. Write the mapper.go file and call it in main.go file 3.
Write structs for two different json structures 4. Write a junit for
mapper.go 5. Explain how to execute the project step by step

Here are the steps to execute the above project:

Install Go on your machine by following the instructions on the official
Go website (https://golang.org/doc/install).

Create a new directory for your project.

Inside the project directory, create a new file called mapper.go and
copy the code for the data mapper implementation from step 1 in my
previous answer.

Create another file called main.go in the same directory and copy the
code for calling the MapInputToOutput function from step 2 in my
previous answer.

Create a new directory called datamapper_test inside your project
directory.

Inside the datamapper_test directory, create a new file called
mapper_test.go and copy the code for the JUnit test from step 4 in my
previous answer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project
directory.

Run the JUnit test by entering the following command:

go test ./datamapper_test

This will compile and run the test file and display the results.

If the test passes, run the main file by entering the following command:

go run main.go

This will compile and run the main.go file and output the result of
calling the MapInputToOutput function.

That\'s it! You have successfully executed the data mapper project in
Go.
